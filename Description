Description:

The Python script is designed to analyze and visualize the bus load from a CSV file containing Controller Area Network (CAN) data. It utilizes various libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Tkinter for the file selection dialog.

The script begins by prompting the user to select a CSV file via a file dialog, assuming the file contains columns named 'Date' and 'Time' representing timestamp information. It reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and converts the 'Date' and 'Time' columns into a single 'Timestamp' column in datetime format.

Next, it aggregates data by tenths of a second and calculates the bus load based on the aggregated Data Length Code (DLC) values from the CAN data. The bus load is computed using a specific formula and is plotted over time, with annotations indicating the maximum, minimum, and average bus loads.

The graphical representation provides insights into the bus load behavior over time, aiding in understanding the performance of the CAN system operating at a presumed ISOBUS 250kb/s speed.

Users can leverage this script to quickly analyze and visualize the bus load distribution, helping in identifying peak and low periods of data transmission within the CAN network.
